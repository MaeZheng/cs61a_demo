## Virtual Environments


In order to make use of a virtual environment that you have created when running a Jupyter notebook:
1. Make sure that your virtual environment has been activated
2. Run `ipython kernel install --user --name "demo_env" `, where `demo_env` is the name of the environment you wish to use
3. In your Jupyter notebook, click *Kernel -> Change Kernel* and select your environment (in this example, `demo_env`), from the list.
